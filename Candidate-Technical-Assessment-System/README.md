# Candidate Technical Assessment System
## Student Development Task

### Task Title
Build a Dynamic Technical Assessment Platform

### Task Description
Create a web application that helps in candidate shortlisting through a technical assessment process. Candidates can select their preferred programming languages, take a multiple-choice test, and based on their performance, get access to resume upload functionality.

### Core Features
1. **Language Selection Page**
   - List of programming languages to choose from
   - Multiple selection allowed
   - Start test button

2. **Assessment Page**
   - Multiple choice questions based on selected languages
   - Next/Previous question navigation
   - Submit test button
   - Display current score (optional)

3. **Result Page**
   - Display final score
   - If score meets threshold:
     - Show resume upload option
     - Display success message
   - If score below threshold:
     - Show "Try again later" message

### Technical Requirements
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (framework of your choice)
- Backend: Any language/framework
- Store questions and answers
- Basic user session management
- File upload functionality for resume

### Question Format Example
```javascript
{
    question: "What is the output of: console.log(typeof typeof 1)?",
    options: [
        "number",
        "string",
        "undefined",
        "object"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "string",
    language: "JavaScript"
}
```

### Steps to Complete

1. **Create Landing Page**

   - Add loading states
   - Include progress indicators
   - Style form elements

### Bonus Features
1. **Timer System**
   - Add countdown timer for each question
   - Auto-submit when time expires
   - Display time remaining

2. **Dynamic Question Sets**
   - Implement random question selection
   - Ensure no question repetition
   - Balance questions across selected languages

3. **Additional Enhancements**
   - Progress bar
   - Score analytics
   - Review wrong answers
   - Save partial progress

### Notes

- Add proper validation messages

### Example Data Structure

```javascript
// Question Bank Example
const questions = {
    "JavaScript": [
        {
            question: "What is closure in JavaScript?",
            options: ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
            correctAnswer: 2
        },
        // More questions...
    ],
    "Python": [
        {
            question: "What is the difference between list and tuple?",
            options: ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
            correctAnswer: 1
        },
        // More questions...
    ]
}
```

4. **For Timer Feature**
   ```javascript
   // Timer example structure
   {
       questionId: 1,
       timeLimit: 60, // seconds
       timeRemaining: 60,
       status: "active"
   }
   ```

5. **For Random Questions**
   - Implement shuffle algorithm
